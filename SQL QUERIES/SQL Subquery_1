Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers

# Step 1: Subquery

(SELECT  B.customer_id,
	B.first_name AS customer_first_name,
	B.last_name AS customer_last_name,
	E.country,
	D.city,
	SUM (A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
	INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B. customer_id
	INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C. address_id
	INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D. city_id
	INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E. country_id
WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'So Leopldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid

# Step 2: Add the subquery to the outer statement

SELECT AVG (total_amount_paid) AS average
FROM (SELECT  B.customer_id,
	B.first_name AS customer_first_name,
	B.last_name AS customer_last_name,
	E.country,
	D.city,
	SUM (A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
	INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B. customer_id
	INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C. address_id
	INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D. city_id
	INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E. country_id
WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'So Leopldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid
